If you ever had a moment of frustration trying to read StackOverflow, thrown your hands up in the air at the political news landscape, or gotten angry at the comments under your favorite cooking blog, this Firefox add-on may be just the right thing to vent some of that anger.

Simply put, it replaces all text on the currently displayed page with incoherent screaming.

** Please note:** This add-on may modify the content of text input fields upon activation. If you use it on a highly interactive website (such as your webmail or a wiki page you're currently editing), there is a possibility of data loss.
